# Python API Project
In this project I created two documents, WeatherPy and VactionPy. WeatherPy visualizes a randomly generated list of over 500 cities with varying distances from the equator. Using the OpenWeatherMap API, I retrieved the weather data of each city. I then created scatter plots for the city's latitude versus temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Next I performed a statistical analysis on the data, presenting linear regressions for each relationship in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

For the VactionPy I created visuals and dataframes in order to find best vaction destinations as well as hotels in the area. I showed a map of all cities with varying sizes of their points to show the humidity of that city. I then narrowed down the cities to places that had the best weather. Those cities were then mapped with information boxes on what country and a hotel in the area.
